Subject: Deadline Extension

Hi Emery,

I'm writing to request an extension on the current project deadline.
We've encountered some unforeseen challenges that have impacted our timeline, and I believe we need additional time to ensure we deliver a quality product that meets all requirements.
The main issues we're facing include resource constraints and some technical complexities that require more thorough investigation.
We've already implemented some mitigation strategies, but we need a few more days to complete the work properly.
I understand the importance of meeting deadlines, and I want to assure you that we're doing everything possible to minimize the delay.
I've prepared a revised timeline that shows how we plan to complete the remaining work.
Please let me know if this extension is feasible.
Please don't hesitate to reach out if you need any clarification or have questions.

Best wishes,
Helen Powell
