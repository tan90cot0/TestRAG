Dear Nathan,

I wanted to schedule your annual performance review meeting.
This is an important opportunity for us to discuss your achievements over the past year, identify areas for growth, and set goals for the upcoming period.
I've been documenting your contributions throughout the year, and I'm impressed with the progress you've made.
You've demonstrated strong technical skills and have been a valuable member of the team.
During our meeting, we'll discuss your career development plans, potential opportunities for advancement, and how we can support your professional growth.
Please come prepared to discuss your accomplishments, challenges you've faced, and your aspirations for the future.
I'm looking forward to our conversation.
We should also consider the long-term implications of these decisions.

Yours truly,
Bella Myers
