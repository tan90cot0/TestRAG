Subject: Budget Approval

From: Val Anderson <val.anderson@enterprise.com>

Dear Penelope,

I'm writing to request approval for the proposed budget allocation for the next fiscal year.
After careful analysis and consultation with the finance team, we've identified several areas where strategic investment would yield significant returns.
The budget proposal includes provisions for new equipment, additional staffing, and enhanced training programs.
We've also factored in contingency funds to handle unexpected expenses that may arise during the implementation phase.
I've attached a detailed breakdown of all expenses and their justifications.
I believe this investment is essential for maintaining our competitive edge and ensuring continued growth.
Please review the proposal and let me know if you need any additional information.
I'm confident that with the right resources and support, we can overcome any challenges that arise.

Cordially,
Val Anderson
