Hi Wren,

I wanted to share some valuable feedback we received from our client regarding the recent project delivery.
Overall, the feedback was very positive, with particular praise for our attention to detail and timely communication throughout the project lifecycle.
However, there were a few areas where the client suggested we could improve, particularly in terms of documentation and post-delivery support.
They appreciated our responsiveness and professionalism, which has strengthened our relationship.
The client also mentioned they would be interested in discussing future collaboration opportunities.
I think this is a great opportunity to refine our processes and potentially expand our business relationship.
Let's schedule a debrief meeting to discuss how we can incorporate this feedback into our standard practices.
I'm confident that with the right resources and support, we can overcome any challenges that arise.

With appreciation,
River Bryant
