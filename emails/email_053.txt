You've demonstrated strong technical skills and have been a valuable member of the team.
During our meeting, we'll discuss your career development plans, potential opportunities for advancement, and how we can support your professional growth.
Please come prepared to discuss your accomplishments, challenges you've faced, and your aspirations for the future.
