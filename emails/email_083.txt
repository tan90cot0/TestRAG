Subject: Deadline Extension

From: Wendy Jimenez <wendy.jimenez@enterprise.com>

Dear Uma,

I'm writing to request an extension on the current project deadline.
We've encountered some unforeseen challenges that have impacted our timeline, and I believe we need additional time to ensure we deliver a quality product that meets all requirements.
The main issues we're facing include resource constraints and some technical complexities that require more thorough investigation.
We've already implemented some mitigation strategies, but we need a few more days to complete the work properly.
I understand the importance of meeting deadlines, and I want to assure you that we're doing everything possible to minimize the delay.
I've prepared a revised timeline that shows how we plan to complete the remaining work.
Please let me know if this extension is feasible.
We should also consider the long-term implications of these decisions.

Warm regards,
Wendy Jimenez
