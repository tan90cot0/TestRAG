Hi Andrew,

I'm excited to announce some changes to our team structure that will take effect next month.
After careful consideration and consultation with leadership, we've decided to reorganize our teams to better align with our strategic objectives.
This restructuring will allow us to be more agile and responsive to market demands while maintaining our commitment to quality and innovation.
The new structure will create opportunities for professional growth and cross-functional collaboration.
We'll be holding a team meeting next week to discuss the details and answer any questions you might have.
I'm confident this change will benefit everyone and help us achieve our goals more effectively.
Please feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss this further.
It's worth noting that we've seen positive trends in the metrics we've been tracking.

Respectfully,
Zoe Fisher
